# RANDL


Random Downloader

A simple CLI to download random things from a repository.

randl is powered by a federated network of static-hosted repos. Anyone can host one, anyone can link to others.


## Quickstart

Here is how to add a repository:
```bash
randl repository add <URL>
```
The first repository in this project is: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Bimasakti1024/c05d38ef8b93b8fd7dfb861977dd48e7/raw/37589e33d1547038c4c69e4c9fd796644c73071b/randl-repo.txt
And to remove a repository:
```bash
randl repository remove <URL>
```
Here is how to list all available repositories in your configuration:
```bash
randl repository list
```


Before you can pull, You need to synchronize the repository using:
```bash
randl repository sync
```
Here is how to pull from a repository:
```bash
randl pull
```
The pull subcommand have a flag called `max-depth` which will set the maximum depth for a nested repository.

### Migrating from RTD
This project was previously known as RTD. To migrate, update your binary name from `rtd` to `randl`. Your existing repos list at `~/.config/rtd/` will need to be moved to `~/.config/randl/`.

I did not know there were other CLI tools called RTD, To avoid conflict, I decided to rename it to randl.

## How it works

1. Add & sync
Add a repository URL and sync it locally. This downloads the repo index to your machine.

2. Pull
randl picks a random repository from your local index, then picks a random line from it.

3. Reward or nested?
- If the line is a URL → you get that file as your reward.
- If the line starts with `Nested` → randl fetches that repo and picks a random line from it, repeating until it hits a reward.

## Creating your own repository

Creating your own repository is really simple, You just need:

1. An internet connection.

2. A working http or https server.

3. A text editor.


What you need to do is to run the http/https server and create a text file that are accessible through the http/https server. Here is an example of the repository:

```
# This is a reward
https://pastebin.com/raw/sqg8Ay0d
# If you want to make a nested repository
# that links your repository with others,
# you can use the Nested tag, like this:

```
